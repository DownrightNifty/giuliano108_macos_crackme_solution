## giuliano108's macOS crackme solution

I was looking for a macOS crackme to get started in macOS reversing (and binary reversing with Ghidra in general). I stumbled across this: https://github.com/giuliano108/reverse-engineering-intro

It appears to have been prepared for a conference or something, since there are accompanying slides. It was fun to work through on my own, though, and I recommend it.

My solution is dumped here.
